            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Cleveland Cavaliers at Boston Celtics</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Celtics should be able to win this one fairly easily. The Cavs have looked better in recent games, but better is less impressive when we're talking about a team that has gone 3-7 in their last 10. The Cavs also traded Korver, so they won't have his shooting to rely on. I'm interested to see who takes the shots that were allocated to Korver, but whoever that individual is will be hard pressed to shoot as efficiently as Korver did. Celtics take this one 116-104.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Chicago Bulls at Detroit Pistons</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Detroit Pistons</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bulls will be hard pressed to take this one. Detroit has been a top 10 defense so far this year, which bodes poorly for the Bulls who have been a terrible offensive team. Zach LaVine will have a harder time soaring above Griffin and Drummond compared to most other teams, and the frontcourt of the Bulls isn't enough to stop them on the boards. I'm counting on Drummond to have a great game against Carter Jr and Blake to put up an efficient 24 on Parker. Detroit 118-102.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Washington Wizards at Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The fact that Washington doesn't have Howard for tonight's game already hurts their chances, as his rebounding and physicality would have been welcome against the unicorn that is Embiid. Instead, they'll have to try their small-ball against one of the most physical centers in the league, as well as two of the best perimeter defenders in the league in Simmons and Butler. I'm not liking the Wizards odds of winning, so I say Philadelphia wins 112-107.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Utah Jazz at Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Charlotte Hornets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Charlotte Hornets have gotten screwed if you look at their point diffrential. They're a far better team than their record suggests, and teams that are going into Charlotte will have to be on their A-game against Kemba and the rest of the Hornets. Jeremy Lamb has been playing really well for Charlotte recently, and that could be the help Walker needed to compete against the better teams in the league. Charlotte wins this one 117-113 off of a 31 point Kemba performance.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Memphis Grizzlies at Brooklyn Nets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Memphis Grizzlies</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Grizzlies have been on a losing skid lately, however I think they'll be able to take the opportunity against a weaker Brooklyn team tonight to bounce back. Conley seems primed for a good game, and having Anderson to provide some wing defense should be enough for the Grizzlies to take it. Gasol has the highest RPM in the league, making this Memphis team a threat on any night. Don't be surprised to see Memphis grind this one out, 110-106.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Atlanta Hawks at Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>No one on the Hawks will be able to stop Westbrook. Their wing rotation isn't good enough to slow down George, and their center might be the worst starting center in the league. How is he going to compete against Adams and the rest of the rebounding machine that is the Thunder. Trae Young is going up against an explosive point guard who, when locked in, is one of the best PG defenders in the league. This should be a bloodbath, Thunder, 120-103.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: New Orleans Pelicans at Miami Heat</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New Orleans Pelicans</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Anthony Davis vs Hassan Whiteside should be an interesting matchup, but ultimately I have to give the edge to Davis. His scoring prowess just beats out Whiteside's ability to grab boards. In addition, Jrue should be able to stop Richardson from getting too many points. I think the bench matchups should be more interesting, as Dwyane Wade has been playing great off of the bench for the Heat. But at the end of the day, Pelicans take it 115-111.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Houston Rockets at San Antonio Spurs</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>San Antonio Spurs</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Rockets have been struggling lately, and they just lost Brandon Knight for tonight. The Spurs on the other hand have stayed solid, not a surefire playoff lock, but not a dumpster fire either. Aldridge is the big game changer tonight, and if he has a good game this should be pretty easy for the Spurs. Even if he doesn't, I still have faith that DeMar and the rest of the Spurs will be able to overcome Harden and Capela. As far as I know, Chris Paul is still out, so the Rockets lose this one 117-115.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Orlando Magic at Phoenix Suns</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Phoenix Suns</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This game should be pretty close, but I think that Ayton is light enough on his feet to provide some big problems for Vucevic, and Booker is head and shoulders the best player on the court. Phoenix should be playing a run and gun style to wear down the Magic, and try to build up a lead with their starters before it comes time for the benches to step in, as Orlando's bench has actually been very good to start the year. Phoenix squeezes this one out, 114-110.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Denver Nuggets at Portland Trail Blazers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Portland Trail Blazers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This game was hard for me to call, but I don't think that Murray will be able to stop Lillard, and Nurkic has played well against Jokic in the past. This game comes down to starpower, as Lillard and McCollum can light it up against Murray and Harris. I actually think that Denver has the better bench, but that won't be enough to stop the Trail Blazers, as Portland's bench is no slouch either. I would be surprised to see this game be a blowout either way, but I have Portland winning it 109-104.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Dallas Mavericks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This one was hard to call, as both of these teams have been playing well lately. The Mavericks in particular have been phenomenal, winning 8 of their last 10 and 3 straight heading into tonight. The Lakers are no slouches either, going 7-3 and are coming off of a win over the Pacers. But that win over the Pacers took place yesterday, and I'm sure that the Lakers are tired. This is their 3rd game in 4 nights, and they are bound to be sluggish. Dallas will come out swinging, and snag this one 119-116.</p>
