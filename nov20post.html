            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Toronto Raptors at Orlando Magic</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Toronto Raptors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Even with Kyle Lowry a game-time decision, the Toronto Raptors should be able to stem the run the Magic have had. Vucevic has looked very good lately, but may struggle with the Center rotation of the Raptors, which proves to give every team it faces fits. Kawhi will be able to demonstrate his value on the wing, as the Magic don't have very good wing defenders. I wouldn't be shocked to see the MVP candidate put up 30/6/4 tonight on 52% shooting from the field as the Raptors take it 119-113.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Los Angeles Clippers at Washington Wizards</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Although the Clippers played last night and are on the road, that still isnt enough for them to give the Wizards the edge. The Wizards have been dysfunctional even for them, declaring recently to the media that no one on their roster is untradeable and they're open to offers. They're off to a 5-11 start, which has them situated in 11th in the East. Their record would put them at 15th in the West a whole 14 spots behind where the clippers are currently situated. The backcourt of the Clippers should shut the Wizards down to an extent, enough to take this one 112-104.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Portland Trail Blazers at New York Knicks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Portland Trail Blazers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Knicks started out 2-5, not great but definitely with room for improvement. Since then, they've gone a staggering 2-8, placing them near the bottom of the East with little chance to climb out. Tim Hardaway Jr. has continued to perform, but the more pressing issue for the Knicks is their defensive effort. You have to go back to November 7th to find the last time the Knicks held a team to under 110 points points (league average) and that was in a 5 point win over the Hawks. Portland is an offensively minded team and will prove that tonight, winning 124-110.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Brooklyn Nets at Miami Heat</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Miami Heat</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Goran Dragic is out for the Heat, but that doesn't mean that they are any less the favourites in this game. The Heat roster is solid throughout, and although their all-star is out with a sore knee they still have Richardson, who has looked like a primary option so far as well as Hassan Whiteside. Whiteside is snagging 14 rebounds a game and looks rejuvenated. The last time these two teams played, the Heat won by 13. I dont see this changing much, as Miami wins 117-104 over the Nets.</p>
