            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: New York Knicks at Detroit Pistons</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Detroit Pistons</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Detroit Pistons are a powerhouse, currently occupying the 5th seed in the East. The Knicks have been taking down powerhouses left and right, and are on a 3 game winning streak. My money is on the Pistons to stay their course, and I see some regression from the Knicks as they play a team with an elite frontcourt, who will match up nicely against Kanter and Vonleh. I wouldn't be surprised to see Drummond put up another 20-20 performance, as the Pistons win 120-114.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Atlanta Hawks at Miami Heat</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Miami Heat</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Hawks have stayed subpar, but finally got a win in a 1 point victory over the Hornets (sorry Charlotte). That said, the chances of that happening again are slim. The Heat have a deep, gritty roster that can play tough defense on Young, and force him into difficult shots. In addition, Dedmon will get abused on the boards and in the paint by Whiteside, who has the clear advantage in the center matchup. All in all, the Heat should have an easy time with this one, winning 117-104.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Toronto Raptors at Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Toronto Raptors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Raptors should be the better team here, and I think their style of play benefits them heavily in this matchup. Memphis tends to run a slower pace, which Toronto should be able to push with their focus on transition scoring. Even if the pace stays slow, Toronto has premier isolation players in the form of Leonard and Lowry who are comfortable taking and making shots from anywhere on the floor. In addition, JV is a good post scorer as well as an above average big man passer. Raptors have the tools to win this one, 112-105.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Los Angeles Lakers at Denver Nuggets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Lakers are coming into Denver, which is normally a bad sign for teams wanting to win. But Denver hasn't looked fantastic lately, and the Lakers are going to be upset following their loss to the Magic on Sunday. This is a must-win game for Lebron and the Lakers, and they should be able to take advantage of Denver's relative lack of wings and get favourable matchups. In addition, the athletic centers of the Lakers should prove semi-challenging for Jokic in the paint, and that could be the edge needed. Lakers, 119-114.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Indiana Pacers at Phoenix Suns</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Phoenix Suns</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is absolutely my bold pick of the night, but I really like this Phoenix team with TJ Warren in the starting lineup. In addition, Oladipo is still out, the Pacers played yesterday, and they're on the road. This is the perfect time for a new-look Phoenix team to come in and steal one away from the struggling Pacers team. Devin Booker is sure to put up some big numbers without Oladipo to guard him, and the advantage that Indiana's bench brings shouldn't be enough to get it done. Suns, 110-108.</p>
