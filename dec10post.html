            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Detroit Pistons at Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>These two teams played very recently, and then Detroit played again last night. There isn't anything in that to suggest that Detroit has had a sudden change in ability and is now capable of beating the 76ers. If anything, I would suggest that their loss yesterday to the Pelicans is a far more likely result. Philadelphia takes this one, 119-109.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Washington Wizards at Indiana Pacers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Indiana Pacers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>In Washington's game against Cleveland two nights ago, I said the Wizards would struggle with such a prolific rebounder in Thompson. That held true, as he exploded for 23 points and 19 rebounds in 42 minutes. Indiana, while missing Oladipo, still maintains one of the best center rotations in the league in the form of Turner and Sabonis. Washington's struggles are likely not over yet. Indiana takes this 110-102.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: New Orleans Pelicans at Boston Celtics</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>I'm taking the Celtics here for a couple reasons. Reason one is that Kyrie Irving has looked like the best point guard in the East so far, playing incredibly well on a good Boston team. The second is that Boston's wing depth promises to be a problem for Mirotic and Moore to score on, with their ability to switch almost anything. Boston wins a close one, 118-114.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Sacramento Kings at Chicago Bulls</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Sacramento Kings</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Goodness me are the Bulls dysfunctional. They almost had a full mutiny by refusing to go in to practice the other day, after a brutal 56 point loss to the Celtics. Markkanen didn't help in that game, and LaVine seems to be struggling in the absence of Hoiberg. I wouldn't be surprised to see Sacramento score upwards of 130 yet again on their way to a solid 132-116 victory.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Utah Jazz at Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Thunder have the talent necessary to win this one outright, but in the replay of a first round series from last year, I think they also have the better scheme. Westbrook is taking less bad shots, playing less hero ball, and as a whole seems far more willing to share the responsibility with Paul George, who is having a great season in his own right. OKC has one of the better bench players in the league as well, something I can't say for Utah (Although the addition of Kyle Korver helps. OKC 117-109.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Cleveland Cavaliers at Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Although the Cavs have absolutely looked far better the past couple of weeks than at the start of the season, Milwaukee is still far and away the better team. Brook Lopez should be able to hinder Thompson on the boards well enough for Giannis to swoop in and lay claim to them. They also have George Hill now coming off of the bench for them, which should be a welcome change. Milwaukee 120-110.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Orlando Magic at Dallas Mavericks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Dallas Mavericks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Although I think Jonathan Isaac is a good defender for his age, and should do an adaquate job of guarding Doncic, at the same time I'm not entirely sure you can guard Doncic. He was cold for the majority of Dallas's game against Houston, before scoring 11 straight at the end of the fourth to give Dallas the win. He's an unprecedented talent, and should be enough to lead Dallas to the win tonight. Dallas, 115-107.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Los Angeles Clippers vs Phoenix Suns</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Suns struggled immensely when they went up against the Clippers last time, and since then they've only gotten worse. The Suns are a dumpster fire and have some real issues that they need to iron out before I can think of selecting them to win a game. Ayton should be running the offense as opposed to literally anyone else, and even that wouldn't be enough to give them the win. Clippers take it 112-98.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Memphis Grizzlies at Denver Nuggets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Denver Nuggets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Denver Nuggets just recently picked up Nick Young. I don't know if he's playing for them tonight, just needed to mention that so everyone could be made aware. I like the pickup for them, especially with their entire roster injured. However, with multiple key players injured, it's really hard to pick the Nuggets to succeed tonight. Memphis, 113-105.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Minnesota Timberwolves at Golden State Warriors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Golden State Warriors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Warriors are really good, and should be getting Cousins back any day now. That should be absolutely terrifying to most people following basketball, as the competitive season we all hoped for and have been getting so far will cease to exist. The Warriors will again prove to be the best team in the league. Even without Cousins, the presence of Steph Curry tonight against Minnesota should prove to be too large a hurdle for the Timberwolves, as he scores 35 to lead the Warriors to a 123-115 victory.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 11: Miami Heat at Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>I don't think there's anyone on the Heat who can really guard Lebron, which sucks as that may be the deciding factor in the second last time Wade and Lebron meet on the court. Wade has been playing very well for someone who has already decided this is their last year, and I'm excited to see the rest of his season play out. I just think he'll have a hard time with the defensive intensity of the young Lakers core.</p>
