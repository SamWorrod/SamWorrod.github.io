            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Indiana Pacers at Orlando Magic</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Orlando Magic</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Magic have looked pretty great lately, and are holding onto that 8th seed in the East. The Pacers are currently 5th in the East, but got there on the back of Victor Oladipo who is currently out injured. Vucevic should be able to play well against Turner, who struggles on the perimeter. Fournier should be great as well, since he won't have Oladipo on him. Magic take it, 112-104.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Denver Nuggets at Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Denver Nuggets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Denver Nuggets are still atop the West, and show no signs of stopping tonight against Charlotte. There's no way Charlotte will be able to defend against Jokic, who will be able to have his way with the shoddy Charlotte defense. Even Kemba should have trouble scoring on the Nuggets, who have been a fantastic defensive team so far this season. (Very surprising for me as well). Nuggets have the edge and win this one 119-110.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Philadelphia 76ers at Detroit Pistons</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Sixers have played well against Detroit in the past so far this season, and as Embiid has said he could live in Drummond's head rent free. Embiid has been in a slump lately too, which means that he's due for a bounce back game against a team he has a grudge against. This is a prime opportunity for him, and especially now that they have Butler, I'm expecting big things from them. 76ers 109-102.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Sacramento Kings at Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Sacramento Kings</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Kings have the kind of run and gun pace I would want to compete with the Cavs, who seem to operate better when Tristan Thompson can get set up to grab rebounds near the basket. Fox is absolutely my favourite player on the court in this matchup, and I think he should actually have a really great game tonight with Sexton guarding him. Kings win this one 121-110.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Toronto Raptors at Brooklyn Nets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Toronto Raptors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Toronto Raptors are starting Valunciunas tonight, which is great because he's a fantastic player. The Raptors have two legit starting centers on their roster, allowing them to absolutely decimate bench units by feeding the post. Look to see them capitalize with Ibaka off of the bench. Kawhi should be playing a good game as well, and this one should be a foregone conclusion. Raptors, 117-108.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Oklahoma City Thunder at Chicago Bulls</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Thunder recently came back from a blowout loss against the Nets, as they outscored the Nets by 20 in the final quarter to win on a Paul George Buzzer beater. The Bulls have been awful lately, and have been on a losing skid where the only ray of hope was the return of Lauri Markkanen. Markkanen should help the Bulls tonight, as PF is the Thunder's weakest position in their starting lineup. That said, the Thunder should still easily take this one, 120-104.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Memphis Grizzlies at New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New Orleans Pelicans</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>I really like Anthony Davis's matchup against the rejuvenated Marc Gasol, and I think this could be the deciding factor in this game. I'm curious to see how Conley does with Jrue guarding him, but an unsung hero of this Pelicans team has been Moore, averaging 16 ppg on very good efficiency. If he has a good game, this one could very easily go in the Pelican's direction. Pelicans take this one in a close game, 114-112. </p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Los Angeles Lakers at San Antonio Spurs</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>We all saw very recently what happens when Lebron is feeling good against this Spurs team. There are some very clear issues with the Spurs, not the least of which is their 29th overall defensive rating. That doesn't bode well for them as they match up against the offensive powerhouse that is the Lakers, since the Lakers have also seemed to figure out their defensive woes. Lakers win 115-105.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Miami Heat at Phoenix Suns</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Miami Heat</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Heat have the talent needed to take down this struggling Suns roster. DeAndre Ayton is coming off of the bench now, which makes me think that Hassan Whiteside will have an even easier time of it. However, he could manage to take the game off as he is prone to doing. His performance will be a big indicator of how this game goes for the Heat. Miami wins this 107-95.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Golden State Warriors at Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Dear Golden State Warrior fans: Please don't hate me for not picking the Warriors. The Bucks just look like they could have the edge in this one, with how well Bledsoe and Brogdon have been playing defensively. The Warriors don't have anyone to go up against Giannis, and that could be the difference maker. This game will be very close, but I predict the Bucks taking this one 122-119.</p>
