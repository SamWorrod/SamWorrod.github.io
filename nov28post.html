            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Atlanta Hawks at Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Charlotte Hornets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Hawks managed to snag a win against the Heat last night on the back of a 17/10 performance from Trae Young, whose assist numbers have been stellar so far this year. However, the Hawks are playing a back to back against a Charlotte team they barely managed to beat out a couple nights ago. This win streak should be short lived, and I have faith that Kemba will be able to prevail tomorrow night and put up a solid performance, scoring upwards of 25 against the weaker Hawks defense in a 120-113 win.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: New York Knicks at Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>These teams have yet to play so far this season, but I'm leaning towards the 76ers for a couple reasons. Firstly, Embiid is a far better player than Kanter, and will be able to take advantage of Kanter's lack of defensive prowess to draw fouls and make buckets. Forcing him on the perimeter should prove effective for the 76ers. In addition, Jimmy Butler is a prime defender for Hardaway Jr and should limit the Knick's leading scorer enough to take the win, 115-109.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Utah Jazz at Brooklyn Nets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Utah Jazz</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Jazz have alternated between looking absolutely lost and absolutely dominant, and I have yet to crack the code for which we'll see tonight. I am leaning towards the latter, as Mitchell, Ingles, and Gobert match up nicely against their Brooklyn counterparts. Mitchell especially should be able to shine against Allen Crabbe, who put up just 1 assist in 25 minutes on Sunday. No, I didn't forget points or rebounds. Having a breather on defense should allow Mitchell to lead the team to a 107-100 victory.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Dallas Mavericks at Houston Rockets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Dallas Mavericks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is a risky pick, as the Rockets have looked good so far this year in spurts, and when they're on, they're ON. However, Dallas has actually looked really good too, going 7-3 in their last 10. Doncic has been leading this team, operating ridiculously well in the clutch and I'm not sure who on Houston will be guarding him. The Rockets have lost 3 straight, and although they could be trying to right the ship tonight, I'm not sure if they can do it against the Mavs. Dallas takes it, 120-117.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Chicago Bulls at Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bucks should absolutely rock the Bulls. Giannis and company outclass them at every position, except for Shooting Guard where LaVine probably has the edge over Brogdon. The Bucks are still a top 5 offensive and defensive team, whereas the Bulls have literally the worst offense in the league and a bottom half defense. Robin Lopez won't be able to guard Brook on the perimeter, leaving the lane open for Giannis. Bucks take this 120-105.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Cleveland Cavaliers at Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Thunder are the far better team in this matchup, with George and Westbrook being the two best players on the court by a large margin. Steven Adams may even have the 3rd spot there, and his play against Thompson will be a game-changer tonight. The Thunder are a very strong rebounding team and should be able to get around 5 extra possessions against the Cavs, which should be enough for them to put this one away, 110-100.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Washington Wizards at New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New Orleans Pelicans</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Wizards have looked good lately, but their reliance on small-ball may prove to be their undoing against the bullyball of the Pelicans, who have what could be the best front-court in the league outside of Detroit. I am high on Jrue Holiday, and his ability to lock down opposing guards. It will be interesting to see if the Pelicans choose to play him on Beal or Wall (My guess is Beal). New Orleans takes this one, 119-108.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: San Antonio Spurs at Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This game was hard for me to call, but I like the composition of this Timberwolves team in relation to the Spurs. I wouldn't be surprised to see Covington on DeRozan, locking him up and holding him to an inefficient 18 points and 4 assists. Not having DeRozan's ability to create will hurt the Spurs, who will still have to contend with KAT in the paint. The Spurs don't have a good answer for star centers, and it'll show. Minnesota wins 116-112.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Orlando Magic at Portland Trail Blazers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Portland Trail Blazers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Portland Trail Blazers back court should be enough to handle Orlando, but I've been surprised by this Orlando team before. Vucevic deserves an all star berth this year, and Isaac just guarded Lebron and Durant in two straight games, doing a pretty good job. That said, Portland has the better bench in my eyes, and Collins should be able to do a good job against Bamba. That's not even really mentioning Curry, who should also be a big help. Portland, 121-117.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Phoenix Suns at Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Suns have shown a lot of improvement lately, managing to have a bunch of close games and grab a couple wins. But the grit of this Clippers team will be able to at least partially stifle the Suns, then the Clippers bench can create and grow a lead. These two teams are on opposite sides of the standings for a reason, and Phoenix doesn't have what it takes to be able to go the full 48. LA 112-106.</p>
