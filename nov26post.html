            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Minnesota Timberwolves at Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This should be a pretty low-scoring game, as both of these teams have struggled with offense at various points throughout the season. Minnesota has actually been a very good defensive team, even with the defensive duo of Towns and Wiggins being negatives on the defensive end. Towns is a nightmare matchup for Thompson, who will struggle against the finesse based play of KAT. That said, the Cavs may have an advantage at the guard position, and I wouldn't be suprised to see a close game, 108-104 for the Wolves.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Milwaukee Bucks at Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Milwaukee Bucks are the better of the two teams playing, and the defense of Bledsoe and Brogdon should be enough to at least slow down Kemba. Charlotte has gone 2-8 in games decided by 5 points or less, so if this game goes down to the clutch I can see Milwaukee still coming out on top. But the main issue is that the Hornets have no one to stop Giannis, who is scoring incredibly well in the paint this season. Milwaukee takes it 112-106.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Houston Rockets at Washington Wizards</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Houston Rockets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Rockets are set to match up nicely against the Wizards, who have another of the top backcourts in the league. There's only a handful of teams with a better backcourt than the Wizards, it just so happens Houston is one of those. Count on James Harden and Chris Paul to abuse the pick and roll with Capela against Dwight Howard, who's been going through a controversy of his own right now. Wizards play tough, but are outclassed and lose 117-109.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: San Antonio Spurs at Chicago Bulls</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>San Antonio Spurs</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Not only do the Bulls have one of the worst defenses in the league, they also have one of the worst offenses in the league. San Antonio has struggled more than in the past defensively, but the Bulls aren't the team to take advantage of that. Bryn Forbes should be able to light up the Chicago backcourt and put up some points as the Spurs win 116-107.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Boston Celtics at New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New Orleans Pelicans</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>My main reasoning for this game is that I have a lot of faith in Jrue Holiday's ability to lock up Kyrie Irving. I'm also confident that the Pelicans bigs can abuse mismatches in the post to control the game through offensive rebounds and points in the paint as the Boston frontcourt is fairly small. Having Holiday on Irving will be enough for New Orleans to take this one 110-104.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Indiana Pacers at Utah Jazz</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Utah Jazz</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Pacers have looked awful without Oladipo, and I don't have faith in them to break through this Utah Jazz team without him. Donovan Mitchell is also out (I believe), however I think Utah has enough creators to be able to win this one even in his absence. This is an important game for Utah to win, and they'll have more intensity because of it. My call? Utah, 104-98.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Orlando Magic at Golden State Warriors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Golden State Warriors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Although Orlando has looked very good lately, they played last night. Golden State did not, and the Warriors will be rested for tonight's game. The Magic actually match up nicely against the Warriors, with Vucevic sure to have a good game and Isaac being a decent defender for KD. However, I still don't think the talent level of the Magic will be enough to compete with the Warriors after a back to back. Golden State takes it 120-114.</p>
