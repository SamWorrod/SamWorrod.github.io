            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Milwaukee Bucks at New York Knicks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bucks are the second seed in the East, and have been doing incredibly well. The Knicks have been struggling, and they also don't have anyone to guard any of the big 3 of the Bucks. Even beyond that, having Kanter to go up against Lopez will be a disaster. He's incredibly slow on the perimeter, and will struggle against the three point shooting Lopez provides. Milwaukee takes it, 120-109.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Golden State Warriors at Detroit Pistons</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Golden State Warriors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Detroit played well last night, but the Warriors have looked fairly good lately, a close loss to Toronto a disappointing end to a mini win streak. However, the Pistons are a tough team as well, demolishing the Bulls by 19 last night. Their main issue lies in that they have no one to defend Durant OR Thompson, which will be a rude awakening when the Warriors come out of the gates strong, and win this one 117-112.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Brooklyn Nets at Washington Wizards</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Washington Wizards</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This game I was originally going to say Nets. I think they're the better team, as we saw when they gave a very good Memphis team all they could handle. But there's the issue, they played a game that went to double OT yesterday and now have to be in Washington tonight. That's got to take a toll, and it may be enough for Beal and Wall to be able to take this game over, even without Dwight on the boards against Allen. Wizards win 105-98.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Toronto Raptors at Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Toronto Raptors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Raptors recently played an incredibly close game against the Warriors on Thursday, and after failing to close out in the 4th they came through in overtime. This Cav's team got blown out by the Celtics yesterday and I don't imagine much will change tonight. Toronto should have an easy time against this weaker, tired, Cleveland squad. If they win by less than 10 I would be shocked, Raptors 118-102.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Chicago Bulls at Houston Rockets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Houston Rockets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Rockets absolutely demolished the Spurs yesterday, and are facing a far weaker Bulls team who lost to Detroit last night. Both teams are on back to backs so that's not an issue for either team, and I have more faith in Harden and Paul than I do in Carter JR and LaVine. Houston should be able to continue their winning ways tonight, taking this one 113-99.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Boston Celtics at Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is a hard one for me to judge, but I really like what Covington has brought to this Minnesota team. Since the trade, they've been 4th in defensive rating and have looked very sharp, absolutely destroying the Spurs. KAT is a matchup nightmare for the Celtics, who don't have anyone to deal with him. The Timberwolves win this one 119-114 despite a 30 point performance from Irving.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Indiana Pacers at Sacramento Kings</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Sacramento Kings</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Sacramento Kings lost a close game yesterday to the Jazz, but they should be able to turn it around tonight against the Pacers. No one on Indiana is fast enough to keep up with Fox, and the three-point shooting of the Kings should prove tricky for Indiana to handle. The advantage of Sabonis coming off of the bench should be at least partially offset by Bagley, who has been playing incredibly well in his own right. Sacramento wins a close one, 116-113.</p>
