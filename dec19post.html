            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: San Antonio Spurs at Orlando Magic</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>San Antonio Spurs</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This game was tricky to call, because it's hard to figure out where exactly the Spurs stand. I think Aldridge will be able to play Vucevic better than most other centers, since he's a physical yet fairly quick defender, and his small forward and shooting guard are above average rebounders for their position (Nothing crazy, but definitely decent). DeRozan should be able to outplay Fournier, and beyond that neither team has any standout players. Gay vs Gordon may be the decider, but I'll take Gay there. Spurs 114-110.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: New York Knicks at Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The 76ers play a physical, dominating style of basketball, with their three best players all being above average athletes for their respective position. They absolutely need to make a trade at the deadline to deal with the lack of spacing they have, but beyond that the 76ers don't really have any glaring weaknesses. Butler should be able to lock up Tim Hardaway Jr, which should free the rest of the roster to take it a little easier on the defensive end. The 76ers win 113-103.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Cleveland Cavaliers at Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Charlotte Hornets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Hornets are far and away the better team here, but yesterday Cleveland beat a team I though was way better than them so stranger things have happened. That said, Cleveland also played in a thriller last night, and is bound to be tired. Fun fact about Colin Sexton, he's shooting 40% from 3 so far this season, a far higher clip than I expected from him coming into the season. However, Kemba should still eat him up, and score 25 en route to a 115-107 Hornets victory.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Phoenix Suns at Boston Celtics</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Boston Celtics are far and away the better team, and have rocketed up the net rating charts since moving Jaylen Brown to the bench. They had an 8 game win streak that only recently ended at the hand of the Pistons, and that took Hayward and Brown combining for 8 points. I doubt that will happen again against Phoenix, who has one of the worst benches in the league. Irving should also go off with no one to guard him, and Boston ends this Phoenix win streak 116-104.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Indiana Pacers at Toronto Raptors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Indiana Pacers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>As much as this pains me to admit it, the Raptors without Lowry have some clear issues. On top of that, they'll be missing Ibaka and JV is still out, meaning Monroe will be the starting center with Chris Boucher coming off of the bench. Indiana has a top 5 center rotation in the league, and will absolutely punish the 3rd and 4th string centers from the Raptors. This one won't be pretty. On top of that, Oladipo is back now which means Kawhi has someone who can actually defend him well. Indiana is on a B2B, but that won't be enough. Indiana, 110-108.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: New Orleans Pelicans at Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Pelicans have gone from being a good defensive team last year to being in the bottom third, which is not good when you look at their opponent for tonight's game. The Bucks still have a hold on the number 1 net rating, and are trailed by Boston and Toronto to round out the top 3. Giannis is on pace to absolutely decimate the record for 8-dunk or more games, so if you're a fan of high-flying, phsical players this is the game for you. Milwaukee 123-116.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Detroit Pistons at Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Timberwolves are one of those teams I have a hard time pinning down, as I never know what version of the team I'm going to witness. However, in a surprise to me, Andrew Wiggins has been playing incredibly well for the past 7 games or so, as well as KAT. The trade seems to have worked out well for Minnesota, even if they may miss the playoffs. Detroit is a physical team, but the big man rotation in Minnesota should be able to handle them. Timberwolves, 114-110.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Brooklyn Nets at Chicago Bulls</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Brookyln Nets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Nets are in sole possession of the longest win streak in the league, and have looked decidedly better these past few games than they did earlier in the season. If you missed Jarrett Allen's block on Lebron last night, I would be sure to check that out as it was a thing of beauty (Here it is for the uninitiated: https://streamable.com/cjqf4). If they can keep this play up, they may be able to make a push for the Eastern Conference Playoffs. They beat Chicago fairly easily, 119-110.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Washington Wizards at Houston Rockets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Houston Rockets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Wizards had a game I said they had to win yesterday against the worst team in the Eastern Conference, and they proceded to lose it by 8. That's not even a close game, and now they have to head to Houston to play again tonight against a team that has won 4 straight, and has finally figured out their winning strategy (Let Harden carry them). Things arent looking good, even with Ariza joining the team now for a homecoming. Houston wins 110-104.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Golden State Warriors at Utah Jazz</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Golden State Warriors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Jazz have struggled immensely this year, starting 14-17 after many thought they would be a lock for the West Playoffs this year on the back of Mitchell and Gobert. They didn't have any real losses in the offseason, so it seems to be more about how teams are gameplanning more and more for Donovan Mitchell, after an excellent rookie season showcased his ability to perform. The Warriors are the Warriors, and can probably guard him better than anyone else in the league. Warriors win this 120-111.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 11: Memphis Grizzlies at Portland Trail Blazers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Portland Trail Blazers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Blazers are a good team that for some reason never seems to come up when talking about the best teams in the league. They absolutely have some flaws, but then again, so do the Grizzlies. The main reason to bet against Portland in this game is that the Grizzlies have excellent perimeter defenders in Anderson and Conley. But Lillard is talented enough to be able to overcome that, and I'm not worried about his ability to put up points, even within the slower game Memphis will play. Portland, 112-108.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 12: Oklahoma City Thunder at Sacramento Kings</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Thunder are a team that I think match up extremely well against the Kings, with Westbrook being fast and explosive enough to keep pace with Fox. In addition to that, they also have an excellent perimeter defense, which is crucial against a team that fields Hield and Fox, a very good young backcourt, in addition to shooters like Bjelica. In addition, their bench has Noel, who should be able to be the athletic presence they need to stifle Bagley a little. Oklahoma City takes this one. 117-113.</p>
