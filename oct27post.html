            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Utah Jazz vs New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Utah Jazz</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Pelicans have been on a tear, and are currently sitting at 4-0 and the top of the Western Conference. But they showed signs of faltering last night against the Nets, and I'm wary to pick a team on the tail end of a back to back. Anthony Davis will bounce back, but the Jazz have been playing good basketball, with Joe Ingles proving he is a top shooter in the league, and Rudy Gobert terrorizing the paint. Jazz take it, 108-103</p>
            <hr>   

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Boston Celtics vs Detroit Pistons</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Pistons are undefeated. The Celtics have looked sloppy. That's not enough to change my view on the fact that Bostons athletic wings should provide Griffin with a real challenge, and their guards are leagues above Detroit. Detroit should dominate the rebounding matchup, but don't count out Horford to make smart defensive plays and keep Drummond honest. I have the Celtics winning 115-106</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Philadelphia 76ers vs  Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Embiid may be out tonight, but luckily Charlotte doesn't have the inside presence to capitalize. They're going to be tired, on the second night of a back to back where they looked very good against a weak Bulls team, but the 76ers are a different beast. Ben Simmons will have a great game, as Charlotte's perimeter defense is not enough to stop him from working his way inside. 76ers, 118-107</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Chicago Bulls vs Atlanta Hawks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Atlanta Hawks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Disclaimer - I love Trae Young. Atlana's trade is looking better by the minute, as he had a monster 35-11 game against the Cavaliers earlier this week. That said, that isn't the only reason I have the Hawks winning. I'm a big believer in going with the rested team, and the Bulls had a brutal game last night against Charlotte. High scoring game with the Hawks winning 123-115</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Indiana Pacers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>There's no sugarcoating it. The Cavs are bad. They have no real defensive presence, and allow guards to penetrate to the basket at will. Kevin Love isn't looking great so far as a first option, but should still be counted on for 18-8 tonight. But Sabonis has been playing extremely well off the bench, and Oladipo should be able to have a dominant performance against the lack of real defensive guards. Pacers 111-98</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Portland Trail Blazers vs Miami Heat</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Portland Trail Blazers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Portland's backcourt has been hot to start the year, and they've gotten good production from their bench to get off to a 3 and 1 start. The Heat are 2-2, but have played 4 mediocre teams. I like Dragic, but beyond that Miami rely on gritty basketball and that won't be enough to beat the Blazers. Watch out for Dame as Portland wins it 117-111</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Phoenix Suns vs Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Memphis Grizzlies</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Devin Booker is out. Phoenix doesn't really have any other primary ball handlers, so they're going to have to play out of the post more tonight. Watch Ayton get 5 assists, but the Grizzlies have a way more balanced roster. Conley will go off, and Marc Gasol will limit Ayton's scoring effectiveness. Grizzlies take it 118-104 </p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Orlando Magic vs Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Orlando Magic</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is my hot take for the night. The Magic have the long, athletic defenders needed to disrupt Giannis, (which still means he gets like 27-8-10). The Bucks played last night, and I think they're focused on their upcoming matchup with the Raptors. Magic's lack of a point guard will hurt them against Bledsoe, but if the Magic can get hot they take this one 120-115</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/oct27giannis.jpg" alt="">
            <span class="caption text-muted">Giannis is making an early bid for the MVP</span>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Los Angeles Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Lebron and the Lakers seem to be figuring it out. Lonzo's stepback over Jokic in their win against the Nuggets was filthy. I'm a big believer in the Spurs continued excellence, but they barely squeezed by the Lakers in San Antonio. If Lebron hits those free throws, they lose. In Los Angeles, I give the edge to the Lakers 128-119</p>
