            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Minnesota Timberwolves at Brooklyn Nets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is a good matchup for the Minnesota Timberwolves because their weakest position (Power Forward) also happens to be the weakest position for the Nets, with Dudley possibly being the worst starting 4 in the league. After that point, the rest of the Timberwolves have the edge over their counterparts, with the possible exception of the point guard position where Russell could be the better option over Teague. Either way, the Timberwolves just have too much talent, and will take this one 119-115.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Memphis Grizzlies at Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This game will be close, as these are two of the current top 3 teams in the West, with Memphis occupying the top spot and the Clippers tied for second. That said, the Clippers' loss against the Wizards was an anomaly, which had Williams and Gallinari combine to only score 20 points compared to the 37.4 they normally score. I have faith they'll be able to rack up the points against this Memphis team, even with Memphis' much improved defense. I'm giving the edge to the Clippers in a close game, 109-106.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Houston Rockets at Detroit Pistons</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Houston Rockets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Rockets just beat the Pistons two nights ago, and much of my logic for that game holds true. Blake Griffin and James Harden had quite a duel, with the stars scoring a combined 80 points between them (Harden got 43 of them, and the win). However, Capela had Drummond's number. I don't see a lot changing in this game, except I don't think Blake will hit 5 threes in a row to make it as close as Wednesday's contest was. My money is on the Rockets, 118-108.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Cleveland Cavaliers at Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Cavaliers put up a good fight against the Lakers on Wednesday, but it wasn't enough to stop Lebron from a great hometown win. This 76ers team is absolutely better than the Lakers are, and I don't think that the Cavaliers can rely on another 21 point performance from Cedi, especially since he'll have Jimmy Butler guarding him. Tristan Thompson won't be able to do anything against Embiid in the paint, and the Cavs have no answer for Simmons. The 76ers should take this easily, 119-105.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Boston Celtics at Atlanta Hawks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Celtics, for all their struggles, are a far better team than this Hawks roster. The Hawks have a hard time when it comes to offensively gifted point guards, as their perimeter defense is very lackluster, relying on Bazemore and Young who are two mediocre at best defenders. Kyrie should be able to eviscerate this Hawks defense, and the plethora of offensively gifted wings Boston has will give fits to the rest of the Hawks lineup. Celtics, 114-102.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Washington Wizards at Toronto Raptors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Toronto Raptors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Raptors are a better team than the Wizards, even with all of their injuries lately. Now that Miles is back and OG is probable, their depth will be more than enough to dispatch this dysfunctional Wizards team. The issue I have is at any moment this Wizards team could just click and prove to be a hassle. However, they couldn't get it done when we didn't have Kawhi and I doubt they're going to be able to get it done tonight against a stronger Raps lineup. Raptors win 117-107.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: New Orleans Pelicans at New York Knicks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New Orleans Pelicans</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Pelicans are like the upgraded version of the Knicks. They have a defensively minded guard in Holiday who is the better version of Ntilikina, and Davis who is the better version of anyone the Knicks choose to put at center. The main matchup I'm excited for is Randle vs Kanter, two offensively gifted Centers who have found continued success on their new teams. I think that the Pelicans just have the edge over the Knicks, with Jrue locking Hardaway Jr up and leading the team to a 109-102 victory. </p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Miami Heat at Chicago Bulls</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Miami Heat</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This one is pretty close, with both teams having the majority of their shooting coming from the shooting guard position in the form of LaVine and Richardson. The difference in these teams comes down to defense, where the Miami Heat have proven they have what it takes to grind it out over the course of 48 minutes, as opposed to the Bulls who don't seem to be nearly the defensive talent the Heat are. Because of that, I think Miami wins this one 112-107.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Charlotte Hornets at Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Kemba Walker has continued his tear, and this past game the rest of his team also stepped up to perform in a win over the Pacers. However, this Thunder team has been a defensive juggernaught, and has the pieces off of the bench to put up real numbers against this Charlotte team that relies a lot more on offense than defense. The Hornets also don't really have an answer for Adams in the paint, and he'll be able to score around 20 tonight as the Thunder win, 123-118.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: San Antonio Spurs at Indiana Pacers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>San Antonio Spurs</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is based on the fact Oladipo is looking to be unlikely for tonight's game. This Pacers team still has some good pieces, but I'm not sold on them without a go-to scorer and a lockdown perimeter defender, especially against a team like the Spurs that rely on a shooting guard so heavily in DeMar DeRozan. I wouldn't mind seeing Aldridge and Sabonis matched up in the paint, however I am not sure how many minutes they'll be sharing the court for. Spurs, 110-106.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 11: Phoenix Suns at Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bucks have the length and defensive prowess to be able to really limit the shots Devin Booker is going to be able to take tonight, and force Ayton to spend more time on the perimeter. That said, I think Ayton will have a good game as Lopez isn't the best defensively minded center, and he should put up a lot of points, even without a sizeable number of rebounds. But at the end of the day, having Ariza to guard Giannis is a disaster waiting to happen. Bucks win this one handily, 122-108.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 12: Orlando Magic at Denver Nuggets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Denver Nuggets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Nuggets have been all over the place lately, starting the season very hot before cooling off substantially. While still in the playoff race, they've definitely struggled as of late compared to the other top teams in the West. Luckily for them, while Orlando has been hot lately they aren't a top team in the West. Murray should be able to feast, and Vucevic isn't a good enough defender to give Jokic fits compared to other centers. Nuggets 120-116.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 13: Utah Jazz at Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have been hot lately, winning 8 of their last 10 as they've advanced up the Western Conference standings. LeBron looks like he's having some of the most fun of his career, and is cementing his spot as the best player in the league with ridiculous performance after ridiculous performance. The Jazz have struggled, and are on the road with Donovan Mitchell being forced to carry their offence with more teams gameplanning for him. He won't be enough to stop the Lakers from taking it 117-113.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 14: Portland Trail Blazers at Golden State Warriors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Portland Trail Blazers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This seems surreal to say, but the warriors 3 all-stars might not be enough. They've gone 2-6 in their last 8 games, and have looked mediocre without Curry. the Trail Blazers on the other hand have looked fantastic, despite an absolute thwacking at the hands of the Bucks on Wednesday. Damian Lillard normally feasts on the Warriors, and not having Curry should limit Klay's effectiveness. I have the Blazers sneaking the victory, 116-114.</p>
