            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Houston Rockets at Dallas Mavericks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Dallas Mavericks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Luka Doncic doesn't have anyone on the Houston roster who can guard him. Harden is probably up there for strongest guard, but lacks the height necessary to bug Doncic when the time comes. The Rockets are still limited as far as what the team can do, and I think it will show tonight when they have their back to the wall and are forced to rely on Harden again. Dallas, 117-109.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Sacramento Kings at Indiana Pacers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Sacramento Kings</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Indiana Pacers just had a good game against the Magic in which they absolutely crushed the Orlando squad. The Kings also recently had a game where they demolished a weak Cleveland roster. This one really could go either way, but I like the Kings in this matchup. The Pacers should have some trouble with Fox, who is coming off of an excelent performance. All that should lead to a close game and a Sacramento win, 115-113.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Denver Nuggets at Atlanta Hawks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Denver Nuggets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Denver Nuggets should demolish the Hawks. The Hawks don't have a good starting center, and the Nuggets have one of the best starting centers in the league. (Personally, I have Jokic 3rd behind AD and Embiid.) This should be an absolute slaughter by the Nuggets, and unless Trae puts up 30 points and 10 assists, I'm not expecting much from the Hawks. Denver wins 121-105.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Brooklyn Nets at New York Knicks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New York Knicks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Knicks are a team I have yet to really figure out, but the way I see it they're rested and hungry to snag a win off of a Brooklyn team that won(!) in OT yesterday against the Raptors, and is going to be resting on their laurels tonight. Brooklyn has actually looked very good lately, but I really like the PG switch that New York did to put Mudiay in the starting lineup. New York takes this one 109-105.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Washington Wizards at Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Cleveland Cavaliers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>This is an odd choice to be sure, but I think that Tristan Thompson is the X factor in this game. He has looked rejuvenated, and has been averaging and insane amount of rebounds. Washington still doesn't have anyone at that Center position since Dwight is out, and should struggle big time inside. The real question is how Sexton can do against Wall, but I'm not feeling too bad about it. Cleveland, 104-102.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Los Angeles Lakers at Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Memphis Grizzlies</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Lakers struggled yesterday against the Spurs, and showcased that they can have issues with some of the bigger guards in the league like DeRozan. However, DeRozan isn't playing tonight, which bodes well for the Lakers. Ball should be able to adaquately defend Conley, as he is one of the best young defenders in the league. Having Kyle Anderson to guard Lebron is a big plus for the Grizzlies though, and should be the edge they need to win this one 111-107.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Boston Celtics at Chicago Bulls</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bulls have looked better with Markkanen back, but that doesn't mean I'll ever pick them over this Celtics team. Boston just has too much talent across both their starting 5 and their bench to allow one player to disrupt them. They have plently of athletic wings to give Markkanen trouble, and that should be enough for the Boston Celtics to take this one pretty handily, 118-110.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Minnesota Timberwolves at Portland Trail Blazers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>Robert Covington may actually be the best player on this Wolves team right now. Blasphemous, since Towns still plays in Minnesota, however his impact on the defensive end cannot be overstated. On top of that he has been shooting incredibly well so far. I will be interested to see if they put him on Lillard, as that matchup is a very important one. At the end of the day, KAT offensively will be enough to propel the Timberwolves to the win, 125-120.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Miami Heat at Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Clippers are the superior team in almost every respect. They have the edge in most of the positions starting lineup wise, and have the defensive chops to make Richardson's life a living hell. Once it gets to the bench, it will be interesting to see the battle between Wade and Williams, but I have faith that the rest of the Clippers bench has the advantage. Clippers, 110-103.</p>
