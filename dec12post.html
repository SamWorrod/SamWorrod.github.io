            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Brooklyn Nets at Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Philadelphia 76ers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Brooklyn Nets struggle from the same problem a lot of other teams struggle from when they play the 76ers. Their Center just isn't quick enough to handle Embiid. The centers Embiid has the most trouble dealing with are the smaller quick ones like Horford or Ibaka, not the bigger slow ones like Drummond or Gasol. When you compound that with the addition of Butler, as well as Simmons impact against a weak power forward on Brooklyn's side, this game definitely favours Philadelphia. Brooklyn has been playing extremely well lately though, and I could be surprised. Philadelphia 115-107.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Boston Celtics at Washington Wizards</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Boston Celtics</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Celtics will welcome having Irving back tonight, as the Celtics look to grow their winning streak to 7 games. Since Jaylen Brown has moved to the bench 3 games ago, he has been putting up 21 points on good efficiency, which also allows the starting lineup to thrive with one less ball dominant player. The Wizards don't really have an answer for Brown off of their bench, and are still missing a center, which has proved to be a major issue in their past two games. Boston doesn't have a star center, but Baynes is a physical force who should be able to dominate the boards against Bryant, who started for the Wizards Monday. Boston takes this one 117-106.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Milwaukee Bucks at Indiana Pacers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bucks would probably have won this one even with Oladipo playing, however the Pacers are still not a pushover without him. Turner and Sabonis are one of the best center rotations in the league, and are capable of abusing bad matchups. I'll be interested to see how Lopez does against Turner, who is fairly quick for someone his size. Giannis should still have a great game, I'm expecting him to be guarded by Young who shouldn't hamper him too much. Bledsoe and Brogdon are primed for a good game against Collison, who - while still good - hasn't been as efficient as these two Bucks guards. The Bucks win this one 121-113.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: New York Knicks at Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>New York Knicks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>I would have said the Cavs if someone had asked me this a couple days ago, but then Tristan Thompson went and got himself hurt. His rebounding and scoring presence will be sorely missed, as he had stepped up this season and had already passed his Offensive Rebounding total from last year. His injury will definitely hurt Cleveland this season, which may be good for their tanking plans as they aim to pick up another good player. The Knicks have been subpar lately, losing 4 straight after a shocking OT win over the Bucks. If there's a game they can use to turn it around, it's tonight. Knicks win this one 102-96.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Detroit Pistons at Charlotte Hornets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Detroit Pistons</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Detroit Pistons and the Charlotte Hornets have already played each other this season, and it took Tony Parker scoring 24 off the bench for Charlotte to get the win. Parker isn't having a bad season by any means, but 24 is definitely above average for him this year. As for the Pistons, this team really is a 2 person show, with either Griffin or Drummond leading the team in all 5 major categories. An interesting side tidbit - Drummond is averaging 1.4 steals a game, numbers I definitely wouldn't expect from him. If these two show up, and Detroit gets one more player operating well, they take this one 113-103.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Oklahoma City Thunder at New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Thunder are the third best rebounding team in the league, as well as the best defensive team in the league. The Pelicans are also a good rebounding team, but their defense is only 24th in the league, absolutely shocking numbers for a team that has both Jrue Holiday and Anthony Davis, thought to be two of the better defenders in the league. I really like the dynamic that has formed between Westbrook and George, and Ferguson has really stepped up into a starting role for the Thunder. OKC wins this one 115-109.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Portland Trail Blazers at Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Memphis Grizzlies</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Memphis grit and grind tactics have served them well so far this season, as they hold the 6th seed even after a 2 game losing skid dropped them a couple of spots in the West standings. Their defensive rating is helped greatly by having Kyle Anderson, and Mike Conley is also a good defender for his position. That could come in handy tonight as they play Portland, a team with extremely good starting guards, but whose remaining roster have struggled at times. Portland also played last night, and is bound to be tired and unable to stick with Memphis as they win 106-100.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Atlanta Hawks at Dallas Mavericks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Dallas Mavericks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The last time these two teams played, Atlanta came back from an insane deficit to win a thriller on the back of a magnificent performance from Trae Young. Since then, Dallas has really started to figure out that Luka is their best player by a mile, and their team has looked a lot better for it. Having Jordan and Barnes to deal with Collins should be enough for Dallas to cruise to an easy victory here, 118-116.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Miami Heat at Utah Jazz</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Utah Jazz</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Utah Jazz are the better team here, and I especially like what Rubio brings to this matchup. Miami's starting guards can't really compete with Utah's, and I also think Gobert is a better center than Whiteside, even when Whiteside is focused. This game should support that, as I can see Gobert putting up an efficient 18-10 while Whiteside struggles with an 8-10 performance himself. Utah takes this one in a close game, 114-112.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: Minnesota Timberwolves at Sacramento Kings</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Sacramento Kings</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Sacramento Kings have just snagged their 14th win, a feat that took them 26 games. Last season, that same 14th win took them 47 games to get. This can be greatly attributed to the improvement in their young players. On the opposite side of the spectrum, both Towns and Wiggins seem to have stagnated to a certain extent this season, and are being kept afloat by the defensive prowess of Covington and the excellent bench play of Rose. The Kings should be able to take this matchup playing a run and gun style that limits Covington's ability to disrupt the halfcourt offense. Kings win, 122-114.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 11: Toronto Raptors at Golden State Warriors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Golden State Warriors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The last time these two teams played, it was an OT thriller which showcased a duel between Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard. The Raptors just barely managed to squeak out a win over a Warriors team without Curry or Green, and I'm not too thrilled about their chances tonight. Lowry had a bounce back game last night, scoring 21 points to go along with 7 assists and 5 rebounds in 32 minutes of play, and hopefully he can continue that tonight. But having Green back for the Warriors means they have a far better defender to go against Siakam, who scored 26 points the last time these two teams played. I think the Warriors take this one in a close game at home, 119-115.</p>
