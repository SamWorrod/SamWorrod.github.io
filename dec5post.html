            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 1: Denver Nuggets at Orlando Magic</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Denver Nuggets</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Nuggets are an interesting matchup against the Magic, as both teams have offensively gifted centers who can play on the perimeter very well. The differences between these two teams lies in the fact that the rest of the Nugget's lineup is also very good, whereas the Magic have some questions at the wing position. Jamal Murray should be able to score quite a few points on Augustin, leading to a victory for the Nuggets, 119-109.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 2: Golden State Warriors at Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Golden State Warriors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Golden State Warriors are the far superior team here, especially now that they have Steph back. This team beat Cleveland when they had Lebron, Love, and Korver. What are Sexton and Osman going to do against them? Kevin Durant will be able to go off against whatever wing is unlucky enough to guard him, and Steph will dance circles around Sexton. I wouldn't be surprised to see Durant/Steph/Klay put up a combined 80-90 points tonight. Cleveland loses 120-102.</p> 
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 3: Washington Wizards at Atlanta Hawks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Washington Wizards</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>John Wall isn't playing tonight, which means we get a prime opportunity to see Bradley Beal in all his glory. I think Beal is one of the top players in that 25 years old group, as his versatility on offense as well as defensive capabilities make him a top tier shooting guard in the league. The Hawks don't really have the personnel to deal with Beal and Porter, so this one should be pretty safe for the Wizards. Washington, 106-100.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p></p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 4: Oklahoma City Thunder at Brooklyn Nets</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Oklahoma City Thunder</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Thunder's rebounding prowess makes them a favourite in most of the games they play, and tonight is no exception. Steven Adams is a physical force, and should be able to bully Allen inside. Westbrook is athletic enough to make D'Angelo Russell struggle on the offensive end. Add in Paul George, who has settled nicely into the secondary option role after his time as the primary option, and you have a Thunder win, 117-111.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 5: Philadelphia 76ers at Toronto Raptors</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Toronto Raptors</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Raptors lost a tough game against the Nuggets, and the Sixers have been looking good lately. However, Kawhi is able to lock down Jimmy Butler pretty consistently, and I think the Raptors will be able to capitalize on Simmon's lack of outside shooting. Lowry is one of the stronger point guards in the league, and won't allow Simmons to play bully-ball. It comes down to Embiid, who is an X-factor in these games. If he's on, Philly could easily take this one. But I'm predicting a 115-112 win for the Raptors.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 6: Detroit Pistons at Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Milwaukee Bucks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Bucks have the length and rebounding prowess to make Drummond's job tonight a lot more difficult. I'll be interested to see how Detroit's frontcourt fares, but I think Giannis will be able to get to the rim at will, and really make the rest of Detroit struggle to deal with him. Bledsoe has also been playing well this season, and should prove an issue for Reggie Jackson, who has also been having a decent season. Bucks win 116-110.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 7: Charlotte Hornets at Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Minnesota Timberwolves</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Timberwolves have really stepped up defensively since getting Covington, and I'm excited to see how they deal with Kemba, who plays the one position where the Timberwolves defense might be the weakest. Covington should be able to provide help on the wings, but I'm not sure if he can guard 1's. Either way, the rest of Minnesota's roster is too talented to lose this game. They even have the better grizzled backup point guard! Minnesota, 110-103.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 8: Dallas Mavericks at New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Dallas Mavericks</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>I just really like the Mavericks. I think that Deandre Jordan is a pretty good counter to AD in the middle, as he's a very athletic big man. The main thing here is that New Orleans doesn't have a capable defender for Doncic. Jrue is just a little small, AD is just a little big, and the rest of the team doesn't have what it takes. Because of that, I think we'll see the Dallas upset, 112-109.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 9: Los Angeles Clippers at Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Clippers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>I think the Clippers are just the better team here honestly, the Grizzlies are a very talented squad but the Clippers have better depth, and the defensive chops to hold down the two stars of Memphis. JJJ has been playing very well lately, and scored 36 points the other night in a big win. But the Clippers don't need star power, as they get consistent production from the whole roster every night. Clippers, 113-107.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Game 10: San Antonio Spurs at Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">My Pick:<p>Los Angeles Lakers</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Why I'm Rolling with them:</p>  <p>The Spurs have struggled pretty heavily in the past 2 weeks, with multiple 30+ point losses at the hands of mediocre teams. The Lakers are not a mediocre team, and should be able to capitalize on the weaknesses shown by the Spurs recently. A lot of the blame for these losses rests on a lack of defensive effort by the Spur's starters, in which LMA may be their best defender. That's not a good thing. Lakers take it decisively, 120-107.</p>
